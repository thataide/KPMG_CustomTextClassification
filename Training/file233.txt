Specifies the unit in which a quantity is expressed. For example, a round lot is a normal unit of trading of a security, which in the United States is usually 100 shares of stock. Each stock exchange has its own regulations regarding round lot sizes: they can range anywhere from 1-100 shares, depending on the exchange. Any quantity less than this normal unit is referred to as an odd lot.
