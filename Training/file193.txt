Specifies the start date of the section of a reinsurance contract section. A reinsurer (cessionary) is in obligation to cover the risk as of the start date. At first, the start date of the reinsurance contract is copied to all the sections and coverages that belong to the reinsurance contract. If amendments terminate sections or coverages and provide new sections or coverages, each of these gets a start date as of the amendment. A section start date must not start before or after the term of a reinsurance contract.
