Specifies the lot of a position held in a financial instrument that is to be covered by a collateral pool. The lot ID is used to allocate sales to purchases so that a purchase price can be deducted from a sales price to calculate the gain. An inflow is assigned to one new lot ID and outflows are allocated to one or more existing lot IDs.
